The sensor was about 5 meters from the ""real"" bank at that point in time. We took water samples within 10 meters down the river from the sensor because the river sediment was so fine that sampling disturbed sediment so that it may have interfered with the sensor readings.","Site weather = Sunny; 22C. I provided a diagram (sketch) of the site with estimated distances in the uploaded files section in this form. The bank was level with fine and course sediments - if vegetation was present it was grasses on the bank (grasses appeared to be some Phragmites sp. and/or Paspalum denticulate). There was a steep incline up to a terrace (but it was not more than 4 meters long) and the terrace was vegetated with hardwoods (dominated by Platanus occidentalis). Most importantly; there was a dry; ephemeral tributary at the ""real"" bank (see sensor notes)nearest to area we sampled. There was evidence of erosional deposition present. The source of the ravine/tributary was a bare/muddy watering area of a densely populated cattle ranch. The river sediment was so fine that getting it through the filters was incredibly difficult (especially when using a 50 milliliter syringe) and therefore we used many filters. It would have been easier to use smaller syringes; but trying to fill a 500 milliliter bottle with a small syringe would have been tedious). Therefore the ""filtered water"" sample (BWT - filtered) had to be filled with non-filtered water. We managed to fill it to nearly 150 milliliter of filtered water; but it took 30 mins and we couldn't do that 3-4 more times. Therefore; we filled the remaining 400 milliliters with unfiltered water. Unfiltered noted on bottle. The unfiltered bottle (BWT) is only 50 percent filled due to the cap not being screwed on enough during transport to lab. All vials and bottles were individually wrapped and so the water did not contaminate other samples in the cooler.",https://water.weather.gov/ahps2/hydrograph.php?wfo=fwd&gage=hibt2&hydro_type=0

We waited for 15 minutes to collect the sensor. The sensor was in water for 61 minutes from 7:44pm to 8:45pm. We had to leave because it is already dark and we needed to drive about one hour to be back to my lab.,We arrived at the site at about 2pm on 5/22/2023 and a heavy rain started at about 2:10pm. We had to leave the site for another site. We came back around 7:30pm and it was overcast.,N/A

We thus sampled water from a fishing deck several feet south to the boat ramp. The water at the fishing deck was very deep and water was full of sediments. We had to replace a filter for every two syringes of water. Because water was deep at the fishing dock we took sediment samples at the boat ramp where the sediment is mainly gravel. It took us a long time to filter fine sands for sampling. Due to the muddy river water and gravel sediments it thus took us about 2.5 hours to finish the sampling. On the date (5/22/2023) of sampling it rained heavily in Blountstown and Tallahassee upstream of the sampling site.,N/A
